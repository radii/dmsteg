DM-Steg: a deniably-encrypted block device

For an overview of the Steg specification and DM-Steg, see the .pdf file on http://dmsteg.sourceforge.net

You will need:
	- libdl. I understand this is part of libc.
	- A recent version of libdevmapper, distributed inside LVM2: ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/lvm2/
	- A libcrypto with XTS support, included in OpenSSL >=1.1.0. This is not yet released so you'll have to go to http://www.openssl.org and grab the development sources from CVS. Rather than updating my system, I find it easier to keep a new libcrypto.a in my home directory and link to it statically. Change the Makefile if you want to link dynamically.

To install:
	make
	(as root) make install

To overwrite a device with pseudorandom data (you probably want to do this before you first use Steg on it):
	stegdisk <device/file>
		erase 0

To remove all traces of aspects from a device:
	stegdisk <device/file>
		nuke 0

To create an encrypted aspect directly on a block device:
	stegdisk <device/file>
		new 0 100% MyAspect
		write
		quit

To create two equal sized encrypted aspects inside a transparent aspect:
	stegdisk <device/file>
		new 0 100% Transparency -
		open 0
		new 0 50% AspectOne
		new 0 100% AspectTwo
		write
		quit

To set up your system for mounting aspects:
	Apply the kernel patch:
		cd linux-3.2-rc3
		patch -p1 < dmsteg-0.9-linux-3.2-rc3.patch
	Use menuconfig to enable DM-Steg. Enable:
		'General setup' -> 'Prompt for development and/or incomplete code/drivers'
		'Device drivers' -> 'Multiple device driver support (RAID and LVM)' -> 'DM-Steg target (EXPERIMENTAL)'
	Build and install a lovely new kernel:
		make
		make install
		make modules_install
	Add stegd to your bootup scripts
	Reboot with new kernel

To create a filesystem on an aspect:
	stegsetup <block device>
	mkreiserfs /dev/mapper/stegX	(the device stegsetup reported last)
	dmsetup remove_all

Once a filesystem is created, mount it like this:
	stegmount <block device> /mnt

And unmount it like this:
	stegumount <block device>
Or this:
	stegumount /mnt
	dmsetup remove /dev/mapper/stegX

Good luck!
